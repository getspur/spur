# Publish the cloud-build scripts as an S3 bundle for CI.
#
# scripts/cloud-build is a git-tracked SYMLINK into the sibling spur-notebook
# checkout (../../spur-notebook/scripts/cloud-build) — on a GitHub runner
# there is nothing behind it. release-dist.yml restores this bundle to the
# sibling path on the runner so the symlink resolves there exactly like it
# does on a workstation. Same pattern as the zigbuild macOS SDK bundle and
# the e2e VM toolchain provisioner, which also live in the sccache bucket.
#
# Re-run this whenever the cloud-build scripts change (it snapshots the
# WORKING TREE of the sibling checkout — the same bytes local dispatches
# use — not a git ref).
#
# *.local.env files are excluded on purpose: CI must take its golden AMI
# from the SPUR_BUILDER_AMI_ID repo variable, not from a workstation-local
# override (config-aws-my.local.env would silently overwrite the workflow's
# AWS_AMI_ID env because the local file is sourced with a plain export).
