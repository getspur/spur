## Why SPUR

Running one coding agent is simple. Running several across vendors, repositories, and worktrees quickly becomes an operations problem.

SPUR is a Rust-native terminal application that sits above the agents you already use. It turns a task or issue into a durable plan, delegates work into isolated git worktrees, streams progress into one TUI, and keeps a human in control of every change that reaches the staging branch.

| You need | SPUR gives you |
|---|---|
| One place to operate a mixed agent fleet | Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, OpenCode, Kiro (partial), and generic ACP agents behind one interface |
| Safe parallel execution | One isolated git worktree per worker, with liveness checks and orphan cleanup |
| Review before integration | Approve, reject, modify, or retry every worker result from a shared review lane |
| Predictable merge order | DAG-aware plans and topological cherry-pick onto a staging branch |
| Durable sessions | Event replay, persisted plans, and content-addressed outcomes that survive restarts |
| Cross-vendor visibility | A unified cost ledger and analytics across supported agent CLIs |
| Code-aware delegation | A tree-sitter code graph with stable symbol identities and incremental rebuilds |
| Review away from the terminal | An optional Telegram frontend backed by the same orchestration state machine |

> **DAG-aware planning and integration · 1:25.** The [featured demo above](./docs/demos/spur-dag-aware-multi-agent.webm) shows staged dependencies, parallel branches, plan inspection, and convergence into one review flow.

## Quick start

You need Git and at least one supported coding-agent CLI installed and authenticated.

```sh
npm install -g @getspur/spur-cli

cd your-project
spur init
spur
```

`spur init` discovers available agents and creates the project configuration under `.spur/`. Once the TUI opens, enter a task directly or select one from your project-management integration.

Validate the generated configuration at any time:

```sh
spur config check
```

Prefer not to install globally? Run SPUR through npm:

```sh
npx @getspur/spur-cli tui
```

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    task["Task or issue"] --> brain["Brain agent"]
    brain --> plan["DAG plan"]
    plan --> worktrees["Isolated worktrees"]
    worktrees --> worker1["Worker A"]
    worktrees --> worker2["Worker B"]
    worktrees --> worker3["Worker C"]
    worker1 --> review["Review lane"]
    worker2 --> review
    worker3 --> review
    review --> staging["DAG-ordered staging branch"]
```

- The **brain** reasons about the task, chooses workers, and submits a plan.
- **Workers** execute bounded subtasks concurrently in isolated worktrees.
- SPUR records lineage, events, outcomes, and cost while work is running.
- The **review lane** keeps integration human-controlled; rejected work can retry with your feedback.
- Approved commits land on a staging branch in dependency order.

SPUR speaks [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol) to agents and exposes delegation tools over MCP. It coordinates agents; it does not replace their in-session experience.

## Core capabilities

- **Cross-vendor brain switching.** Move orchestration between vendors when a model rate-limits or a different agent is a better fit.
- **Parallel and DAG-aware delegation.** Dispatch independent work concurrently while preserving dependency order.
- **Structured review and retry.** Every completion becomes a reviewable result with bounded Reflexion-style retries.
- **Local-first durability.** Plans, events, and outcomes remain inspectable on disk and recover after interruptions.
- **Unified analytics.** Read supported vendors' local session data into one DuckDB-backed cost and usage view.
- **Plan mutation.** Split, replace, or amend work while a plan is in flight.
- **Multi-brain safety.** Ownership and session checks prevent two orchestrators from mutating the same plan accidentally.
- **Code-graph context.** Stable symbol IDs, call edges, documentation sections, and incremental indexing support code-aware retrieval.

## Scope

SPUR is an orchestration and review layer for a fleet of coding agents.

It is not an IDE, chat client, CI/CD system, or fully autonomous “set and forget” engineer. The review gate is intentional. SPUR works alongside your editor, project-management tool, and agent subscriptions rather than replacing them.

Native project-management support currently covers [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) and GitHub Issues through `gh`.

## Configuration

Configuration lives in `.spur/config.toml`. Agent entries describe the executable, transport, role, permissions, cost tier, and delegation hints used by the brain when routing work.

- Start with [`spur init`](./docs/user-docs/00-getting-started.md).
- Browse the [example configuration](./.spur/config.toml.example).
- Read the [configuration guide](./docs/user-docs/05-configuration.md).
